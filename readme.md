# Roadblocks
Users begin a work session, writing whatever they would like. We measure keyboard input and brain data as they write. We develop a machine learning model that predicts when the user will approach a roadblock. A roadblock is defined as when the user does not write the predicted amount of words expected to be produced in the future time interval. If the user hits a roadblock we offer helpful alternatives such as taking a break or recommending research articles based on the content they wrote.
